Problem : New Customer Active Address
Janus Miguel > Hello Guest, Thank you for contacting Comcast Live Chat Support. My name is Janus Miguel. Please give me one moment to review your information.
Guest > My Issue: New Customer Active Address
Janus Miguel > Hi! How's your day going so far?
Guest > A little long, but productive
Guest > how about yours?
Janus Miguel > That is great to know you had a productive day! I am doing good. Thank you for asking!
Janus Miguel > Also, I did not see any order information. Just to clarify, are you an existing customer or are you planning to setup a new 
account with us?
Guest > New customer
Janus Miguel > Thank you for clarifying and choosing Comcast! I will be more than happy to help you set up a new account! Will it be okay if I 
ask you a few questions along the way?
Guest > Sure.
Janus Miguel > Alright! May I please have your name and the complete service address?
Guest > I am mostly wondering if the 6 months of hbo is still included on the
Guest > $49 double play. with 50mbps internet and 45 chanels
Guest > 6929 N Haven Portland OR
Guest > Joseph Devlin
Janus Miguel > Thanks Joseph!  I will double check on that for you.  May I know the zip code as well?
Guest > 97203
Janus Miguel > Thank you so much! Will it be okay if I put you on hold for 2 to 3 minutes as I review the location?
Guest > sure.
Janus Miguel > Thanks Joseph!
Janus Miguel > Thank you for waiting! I was able to verify that the address is serviceable by Comcast! 
However, there is still an active account with no disconnection nor transfer order. Do you know and have direct communication with 
the current person who is living there?  
Janus Miguel > Also, the Blast plus package does not have the free HBO for 6 months promotion anymore as of today.
Guest > So we take over the lease on June 15th.  I am not aware of who the current renters are.  Also are you sure about the Blast plus package? I could of sworn that a few weeks ago when I looked it said it went until June 30th.
Guest > oh whoops, I ment the 17th
Guest > *meant
Janus Miguel > Yes, I did a double check that the offer with HBO is not here anymore.  It may be in a different area but upon checking your area, there is HBO included for now.
Janus Miguel > It may change again next month.
Janus Miguel > About the current tenants, that will not be a problem. Actually as much as I want to set up your account now, we will not be able to do so until there is a 
disconnection or transfer order from the previous account in that said location. No worries though! 
Janus Miguel > What I can do for you is I can file a ticket to our call back investigation team to verify the disconnection date of the previous 
tenant and they will be giving you a call back within 24 to 72 hours for an update. If ever, they will also assist you in setting 
up your account.
Janus Miguel > I will need some further information to complete the ticket if you wish to do it now. Shall we begin?
Guest > OK.
Janus Miguel > Great! May I please have your best contact number, e-mail address, and preferred installation date?
Guest > Also how long does the Blast plus package stay at this price/
Guest > 503-927-1017
Guest > Devlin14@up.edu
Guest > June 17th
Janus Miguel > At this price, it should be until June 30.
Janus Miguel > Thank you so much! Will it be okay if I put you on hold for 2 to 3 minutes as I finish up the ticket?
Guest > yes.
Janus Miguel > Thanks Joseph!  
Janus Miguel > Thank you for waiting Joseph! Here is the reference number of the ticket I made, 130509-000583. Please wait for a call back within 24 to 72 hours.
Janus Miguel > 
I hope I was helpful enough in addressing your concern to the most appropriate resolution of this issue. Is there anything else I 
can assist you further? Please tell me Joseph. 
Guest > Thank you for all of your help.  I think that you have answered all of my questions
